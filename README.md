# Lab 7: Stereo processing
In this lab we will experiment with stereo processing.

![Ideal stereo geometry](lab-guide/img/ideal_stereo_geometry.png)

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
Then open the project.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:

1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
2. [Sparse stereo processing](lab-guide/2-sparse-stereo-processing.md).
3. [Dense stereo processing](lab-guide/3-dense-stereo-processing.md).

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
